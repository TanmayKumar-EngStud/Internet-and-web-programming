      I am Tanmay Kumar.<br />
      I want to be a <b>Hacker</b> and <b>Data Science Developer</b> at the same
      time. ðŸ˜…
      <br />
      I like movies a lot!! <br /><br />
      my favorite movie is <b>The Dark Knight</b>. Most people say that this is
      a <b>crime</b> and <b>drama</b> movie. But I think it is a
      <b>psycological</b> movie. People consider that
      <mark><b>Batman</b></mark> is the real <b>Hero</b> of the movie. <br />
      <b>But</b> actually <mark><b>Joker</b></mark> saves the gotham city, by
      teaching the society actual moral of living.
      <br />
      Joker, although a lying psychopath, is actually the hero in The Dark
      Knight. Before the Joker, Gotham was a mess. Entire sections of the city
      were closed off due to madness, organized crime ran rampant, and the
      majority of important city officials were wildly corrupt. The city even
      tolerated a renegade vigilante who ran around wearing a rubber suit (Okay,
      special armor and carbon fiber, but they don't know that).
      <br />
      I don't hate Batman, but if compare to Joker, Joker outstands the Batman
      over intelligence.
      <br />
      In the whole DC universe Batman is considered to be the most clever and
      smart individual compared to the other members of <b>Justice League</b>.
      He smartly uses his tactics to save the world from evil mastermind. While
      other members of the <b>Justice League</b> just try to use their so called
      "Superpowers".
      <br />
      In this DC universe, Superman is kryptonian. And Keyptonain are considered
      to be the most evolved and intelligent of all the superheroes. But I don't
      know why superman uses his brain that much. ðŸ¤”
      <br />
      If you see any match between Batman and Superman, always Batman wins. ðŸ‘Š
      <br />
      poor Superman!! ðŸ˜µ
      <br /><br />
      Now You might be wondering, why Joker doesn't help the evils to overpower
      the batman so that they (evil) can defeat the <b>Justice League</b>!!
      <br /><br />
      The reason is that Joker is actually a hero, but a psychopath. Even you
      can see in Justice League: Snyder's cut. When batman feels that they can't
      win the fight against the <b><mark>Darkseid's</mark></b>
